# WebGuesser

This number guessing game was built using Sinatra.

This program:

* Generates a random number on startup
* Has a web page where you can enter a guess
* Tells you whether your guess was way too high, too high, correct, too low, or way too low.
* Changes the background color accordingly depending on your guess.
